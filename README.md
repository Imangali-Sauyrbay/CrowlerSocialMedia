# This is Crow'ler, my own joky twitter clone (not relevant nowüòî).

Welcome to Crow'ler, my whimsical take on a Twitter clone! üê¶ This pet project is all about learning and experimenting, so let's set the record straight right away: it's all in good fun, and there's no intention to spread hate or discrimination. üòÑ

## Learning Through Laughter

Crow'ler is my playground for honing my web development skills. I believe that learning should be enjoyable, and what's more fun than creating a playful social media platform? It's a joky pet project that reflects my passion for coding and my love for a good laugh.

## Features Galore

Here's what you can expect from Crow'ler:
- **Infinite Scroll:** Say goodbye to those pesky 'Load More' buttons. With Crow'ler, your timeline just keeps going and going, like an endless stream of tweets.
- **Virtual Scroll:** We're all about performance here. Virtual scrolling means you'll have a smooth and speedy experience, even if your timeline is bursting with tweets.
- **Powered by Nuxt:** Crow'ler is a testament to the power of Nuxt.js. We're doing all this magic on the frontend without relying on any heavyweight backend framework. It's pure Nuxt goodness!
